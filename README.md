On behalf of my assingment I need to create a multiple user gameplay. So me and my team disscussed to create a multiplayer snake game. So this is it. 
This is still in phase 1. In future I will update the new version of the game. 
We may create this game for assignment, but for future reference and better understanding about how the network libraries is working, we will work on this game and try to improve the features.

thnks, WHA.
